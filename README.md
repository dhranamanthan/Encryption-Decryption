# Encryption-Decryption Mechanism
#### The Encryption-Decryption Mechanism project provides a robust framework for securing sensitive data through advanced cryptographic techniques. It includes modules for encrypting plaintext into ciphertext using industry-standard algorithms and decrypting the ciphertext back to plaintext. The project supports symmetric and asymmetric encryption methods, ensuring flexibility and security. Key management and secure storage are integral features, enabling secure key generation, distribution, and storage. The user-friendly interface and comprehensive documentation make it suitable for both novice and experienced developers.

## Encryption
- Encryption is the process of converting plaintext (readable data) into ciphertext (encoded data) using an algorithm and an encryption key. The purpose of encryption is to ensure that only authorized parties can read the information. The encryption process scrambles the data, making it unreadable to anyone who does not possess the corresponding decryption key.

## Decryption
- Decryption is the reverse process of encryption, where the ciphertext is converted back into plaintext using a decryption key. This process restores the data to its original, readable form. Decryption ensures that authorized parties can access the data while keeping it secure from unauthorized access.
